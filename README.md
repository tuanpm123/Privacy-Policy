Privacy Policy
We strictly respect your privacy. We do not record, store, collect information that identifies you as an individual. We do not attempt to obtain any sensitive information. If you contact us via email or other social media directly, we may keep a copy of that though.

We will not sell, trade or disclose any personal information you might give us.

Although we ourselves do not attempt to track your information, our products may contain third partiesâ€™ APIs. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that may be collected by that third party, so we are therefore not responsible for that information.

Our third parties' privacy policy are as follows:

Unity - https://unity.com

Admob - https://policies.google.com/privacy

Policy Updates

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be updated on this page.
